raspberrypi-python-client
==========

A library that provide access to the ATT IOT platform, for the Python language (geared for RPI development).

<!--

### flavours
There are 2 flavours of the IOT library. Use a library according to your needs.
  1. regular: The RPI will act as a single device, directly connected to the IOT platform. You are responsible for creating the device manually on the platform, any assets can be created through the script.
  2. gateway: The RPI will function as a gateway for other devices, which communicate with the gateway-RPI through xbee modules. Devices and their assets are automatically created whenever a new xbee device connects to the gateway.


### Dependencies
  1. The library depend on the [paho.mqtt.client module](http://eclipse.org/paho/clients/python/).
  


  2. the demo template script for the gateway also relies on:
    - [pyserial] (http://pyserial.sourceforge.net/)
	- [python-xbee] (https://code.google.com/p/python-xbee/)

-->

### Installation
- Copy the library to the RPI:
	- Run `git clone https://github.com/allthingstalk/raspberrypi-python-client`
	- or use an ftp client to copy the library to your RPI.
- Run `sudo bash raspberrypi-python-client/setupGrovePi.sh`  in case you have the grovePi shield  
or `sudo bash raspberrypi-python-client/setupNoShield.sh` if you don't have a grovePi shield

### Instructions

  1. Setup the raspberry pi hardware
    - Grove kit shield
    - Push button to A2
    - Led light to D4
  2. Create the device in the IOT platform.
  3. Modify the template script 'Shield_Demo.py' : `sudo nano raspberrypi-python-client/Shield_Demo.py`  
fill in the missing strings: replace deviceId, clientId, clientKey. Optionally change/add the sensor & actuator names, pins, descriptions, types. 
  4. Run the script: `sudo python raspberrypi-python-client/Shield_Demo.py`

- This [guide](http://docs.smartliving.io/kits/linux-raspberry-pi/stepbystep/) contains a full recipe and detailed explenation on all aspects of the process. It guides you into setting up your Grove Pi, SD card and the platform. 
- There's a [trouble shooting section](http://docs.smartliving.io/kits/linux-raspberry-pi/troubleshooting/) you can check out if you are having problems.
- Also make certain that you check out all the availabile documentation that we have for the [raspberry pi](http://docs.smartliving.io/kits/linux-raspberry-pi/).
